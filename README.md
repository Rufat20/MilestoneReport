# MilestoneReport
The goal of this project is just to display that you've gotten used to working with the data and that you are on track to create your prediction algorithm. Please open [this Github link](https://rufat20.github.io/MilestoneReport/) to show a milestone report as a html file.

## Review criteria
  1. Does the link lead to an HTML page describing the exploratory analysis of the training data set?
  2. Has the data scientist done basic summaries of the three files? Word counts, line counts and basic data tables?
  3. Has the data scientist made basic plots, such as histograms to illustrate features of the data?
  4. Was the report written in a brief, concise style, in a way that a non-data scientist manager could appreciate?
